          <hr>
          <p><img class="bio-img" src="assets/images/d3barb.jpg" alt="Diablo 3 male barbarian">Alwyn Durham is an anal-retentive technologically-oriented person who has chosen to partake in the grand adventure that is web development.  He hopes to use the skills gained in this endeavour to force his company to release accessible products, despite attempts by other developers to add in last-minute changes under the guise of agile methodology.
          </p>
          <p>Alwyn also moonlights as a technical writer.  Although that is currently his actual job title, he seems to have become too efficient at it lately due to the fact that writing scripts to automate tasks is far more interesting than doing things like a normal person.  Alwyn is currently using the free time gained to document software accessibility problems, but would prefer to be even more efficient by fixing the problems so that documentation isn't necessary.</p>
          <p>In his other life, Alwyn has been known to play video games, adopt excessive numbers of cats, and eat entire gallons of ice cream in one sitting.</p>
